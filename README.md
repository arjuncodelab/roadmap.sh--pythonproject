# Python Projects Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my Python Projects Repository!
This is where I document my learning journey in Python — from simple beginner programs to more advanced projects as I continue to grow. The goal is to create a clear, organized space that shows my progress step by step.

## Purpose

This repository exists to:
- Track my growth as a Python developer.
- Store and share the projects I build along the way.
- Help beginners find simple, understandable examples of Python concepts.
- Give me a personal workspace to experiment, improve, and learn.

## Project Categories

### Beginner Projects
- Number Guessing Game
A simple command-line game where the user guesses a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.
- (More beginner projects coming soon!)

### Intermediate Projects
- (Coming soon — I’ll be adding projects here as I improve.)
  
### Advanced Projects
- (Future section — will be filled as I work on more complex ideas.)
