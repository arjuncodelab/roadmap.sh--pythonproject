## Beginner Projects — Quick Heads Up

Welcome — this folder contains small practice projects for learning fundamentals.

- Expect short, focused projects (1–3 day scope).
- Each project includes a brief README with setup, run steps, and learning goals.
- You’ll see common files: source folder, .gitignore, LICENSE, and optional tests.
- Projects emphasize core skills: basics of the language, simple DOM/CLI I/O, file handling, and API calls.
- Follow naming and commit conventions in the root CONTRIBUTING.md.

Jump into any project folder to get started — each README has exactly what you need.
